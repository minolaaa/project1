        <td>Composing this project has given me a deeper appreciation for the little trinkits I have. Its also helped me realize the sentimental value they carry. When we started our project picking objects was a very had process for me. It was like all of a sudden all of the little items I stored in my room had a forgotten meaning. This project forced me look past the items themselves but search for the emotions stored in them.</td>
