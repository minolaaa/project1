        <td>I really admired how the photographer was able to give me a full description of their subject without typing a word. I felt like I was able to connect with each person throughout the composition without even talking to them. I believe that was a strength of the photographers and I tried to imitate that when taking my pictures. Something I really enjoyed was the creative process. The whole process of me trying to figure out who my subject is, what message I wanted to portray and how I could do that through film was a fun process for me. While interviewing Sasha I asked her a series of questions and chose which message was the strongest. During this project I formed a new bond with a fellow peer and learned a lot about her in the process. The new bond I was able to form was the biggest gift (besides an A) that I could’ve recived from this whole project. While I loved this project I wish that I could’ve taken more time to receive clarification. I feel like I was confused about the smaller assignments which put me behind which creating my final draft. If I were speaking to someone doing this project in the future I would advise them to ask questions; even if they feel they understand just ask questions for confirmation.</td>
