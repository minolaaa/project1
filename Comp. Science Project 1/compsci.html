        <td>During this project I gained confidence in my ability to code. When we were first assigned this project I was 100% sure that I couldn't do it, that it was too hard. But once I started actually constructing my webpage and styling it I realized that I understood it a lot more than I thought. While there were times when it got hard, in the end I developed a liking towards coding.</td>
