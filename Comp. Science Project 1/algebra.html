        <td>This project helped not only further my understanding of equations, but it was a great oppertunity to practice finding the domain and range of a line. I understood a lot more than I thought I did. When I first looked at the project brief it looked too hard. I thought I couldn't do it because I didn't fully understand domain and range, but once I started filling out the tables it became eaiser.</td>
